## About Our Group

AWS - CLOUD SECURITY - BEST PRACTICES & SERVICES

Our goal for the AWS - Cloud Security, Best Practices and Services is to interact with a group of IT professionals that would like to learn from each other, share stories, and information. You may be interested in this group if you would like to: * identify, learn, observe, monitor, and explore AWS Services that would help us maintain a secured enterprise * build AWS distributed, fault-tolerant applications * design system architectures * study for AWS Certifications*

Every year AWS introduces a large number of products and services; a clear understanding of these products and proper configurations thereof would ensure that we maintain a powerful and comprehensive view of the organization's cybersecurity environment. AWS gives us the ability to perform cloud security activities in a more agile manner; the question is, how much do you know about these services? What are the best practices? What is the most cost-effective combination of security services? Do you have the proper group of individuals to ask these questions?

Furthermore, if your intent is to pursue some of the AWS Certifications; our meetings would discuss the best practices and principles to reinforce the materials that you already know. In our annual planning, we would also integrate Certification MeetUps with the intent to cover study questions, development, deployment of applications, highly available applications, performance, and cost effective.

Some of the few topics that we will discuss in our group are:

* Cloud Security * Penetration Testing * Cybersecurity * Security Bulletins *

* AWS Certifications Resources * Compliance * Security Platform *

* Infrastructure Security * DDoS Mitigation * Data Encryption *

* Monitoring and Logging * FedRAMP and FISMA *

* Inventory and Configuration * Identity and Access Control *
